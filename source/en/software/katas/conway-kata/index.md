# Conway's Kata

This is an exercise on programming paradigms, implement the rules using as many programming paradigms as you know. Personally I recommend testing OOP and ECS.

## Rules of Conway's Game of Life

- A living cell with less than two neighbors: Dies
- A living cell with two or three neighbors: Survives
- A living cell with more than three neighbors: Dies
- A dead cell with exactly three neighbors: Becomes alive
